Back to it.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Sekiro's platinum...
Sekiro and my real work took me all my productivity... But i'm finally back to it.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Prototype

I totally revamp the Tiling system to be more flexible. using the vertical axis now.
There is a small action system too, the main character is now able to move and use a shield.

<div style="background: #616161; border-radius: 3px;">
    <br />
    <div align="center">
        <img src="../img/post/201906/move_perTileUI.gif" />
        <br />
        Flame
    </div>
</div>
&nbsp;

That's all for now, i'm so late now... It will take time, but I will end this project.
