Robots are blue, Tiles are grey...

## How is the motivation since last time?

Some good motivation, but where can I find the time to work on this project!!

## Experience

So this time, I worked on some systematization stuff, so nothing really visible for now.
But I also tried some Material/Shading too, it's super bad but it's fun to play with this!

## Experience

<div style="background: #616161; border-radius: 3px;">
    <br />
    <div align="center">
        <img src="../img/post/holo_shader.gif" />
        <br />
        The homemade hologram shader. It's wip ofc.

        <br />
        This is supposed to be used as the next actions preview.
        Here: Move on the left side

## Coming Next

Next time the first gameplay features will probably work! (let's try)
I need to push all of this on a repository...
