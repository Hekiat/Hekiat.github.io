## Who am I?

I'm Hekiat, a french video game developer actually working in a japanese game company.

&nbsp;
## What is the project?

Building a video game. During the whole process, I want to document the whole process, and relate it.
And of course discuss all of this with people who are interested in it. [twitter](https://twitter.com/Hekiat)
All of this is done on my free time.

## Others

This blog is using Jekyll and a customized [Beautiful-Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme) Theme.

The game (or at least the prototype) will be made in [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4), which I never used before this project.
